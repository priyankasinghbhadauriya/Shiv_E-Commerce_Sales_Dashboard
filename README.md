I've designed an interactive PowerBI dashboard with a user-friendly interface that allows easy navigation through key financial insights using Buttons that direct to dedicated pages:
Steps I followed to build this dashboard
1. Reading the data ⁃ I spent more time with data to understand the structure and what exactly is needed to be fixed to extract necessary KPIs.

2. Data Cleaning ⁃ Made sure the data is clean by arranging and formatting the values in excel, mostly used for breakdown of Date column.

3. ETL with Power query ⁃ In Power BI, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) refers to the process of connecting to various data sources, transforming them, and loading them into a Power BI model for analysis and reporting. This process ensures that data is cleaned, standardized, and made ready for visualization and analysis within Power BI. Managed the relationships accurately by selecting the appropriate cardinality to make sure we getting the correct output when performing the calculations

4. DAX Calculations - Need to build measures to make sure we have right KPIs in our bucket so we can use it show correct insights eg. total sales, profit, units quantity, extracted the sum of amount , sum of profit, sum of quantity, sum of AOV alots of columns

5. Dashboard- After designing the dashboard layout on paper sheet to save time while making the report on Power Bi, started with the dynamic dashboard design to visualize the overall performance and created dedicated page each specific data so user can get in depth of ever and accordingly take the business decisions.
